# Boredom
Boredom is not another JavaScript library. It's a state of mind. Try it. It's simple. 

## API
### Boredom.observe()
Sit on a bench, rock, or some random log and people or animal watch. Try not to judge or be creepy; just observe.

### Boredom.listen()
Listen to the sounds around you. Maybe close your eyes or something. 

### Boredom.walk()
Go for a walk somewhere nice on a beautiful day (_non-recursive_). Remember that beauty is on the eye of the beholder, so let it be sunny, rainy, or otherwise. You choose.

### Boredom.random()
Perform a random act of kindness. Examples: pay for someone for something, donate your time for a cause, whatever - just be kind.

### Boredom.write()
Write anything -- a book, a letter, a story, a nice online comment, etc.

### Boredom.play()
Play an instrument, a game, or anything that's playable. Do it alone, with friends, family, or pets. It doesn't matter. What's important is that you only play.

### Boredom.help()
Help another human being (_or animal_). It isn't always easy to know who/what needs help, so you may need to `Boredom.observe()` or `Boredom.listen()` for relevant events around you.
